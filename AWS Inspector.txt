----------------------------------------------------------------------What is Amazon Inspector?------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	Amazon Inspector is a vulnerability management service that continuously scans your AWS workloads for software vulnerabilities 
and unintended network exposure. Amazon Inspector automatically discovers and scans running Amazon EC2 instances, container images in 
Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon ECR), and AWS Lambda functions for known software vulnerabilities and unintended network exposure.

	Amazon Inspector can be activated for entire organization with a single click.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------Why it is needed?-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Amazon Inspector provides comprehensive vulnerability assessments for your AWS resources, 
helping you identify security issues such as misconfigurations, software vulnerabilities, and unintended exposures.

It evaluates your AWS environment against security best practices and predefined rulesets, 
providing recommendations to improve your security posture and reduce the risk of security breaches.

Seamless integration with various AWS services, including EC2, ECS, Lambda, S3, and more, allowing you to assess the security of a wide range of AWS resources.

Flexibility in customizing assessment templates and rules packages to meet the specific security requirements of your applications and workloads.

Amazon Inspector has minimal impact on the performance of your fleet.

pay-as-you-go pricing model, Amazon Inspector offers cost-effective security assessments without the need for upfront investments in hardware or software.

Integration with Jenkins to automate security assessments as part of your continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines.

Findings by
- Vulnerabilities(Resources)
- EC2 scanning
- Container Image/Repositories
- Lambda functions


___________EC2___________

Agent based scanning: - Need to cinfigure SSM agent
		      - For finding CVEs
Agentless scanning: - EBS snapshots to collect a software inventory from your instances.
		    - Instances scanned using the agentless method are scanned for both operating system package, 
		      and application programming language package vulnerabilities.

For EC2 we need to assign SSM role to EC2 instance which we want to scan
- Deep inspection for Linux instances
	- Amazon Inspector collects updated application inventory from instances for deep inspection every 6 hours.

- Scanning for windows instances: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/inspector/latest/user/windows-scanning.html

To exclude from scanning add the tag: InspectorEc2Exclusion


___________LAMBDA___________

For lambda function scanning.
- CodeGuru provides cwe code for all vulnerabilities (It's showing which type of vulnerability it is)
	- e.g. Insecure_hashing, Logged credentials etc.
- We can prevent lambda code scanning by providing some tags 
	- Lambda function >> Configuration >> Tags >> Add tag/new tag >> key: inspectorExclusion, value: LambdaCodeScanning >> Save
- We can prevent lambda standard scanning by providing some tags 
	- Lambda function >> Configuration >> Tags >> Add tag/new tag >> key: inspectorExclusion, value: LambdaStandardScanning >> Save


___________ECR___________

Scans container images stored in ECR for software vulnerabilities to generate Package Vulnerability findings.
After enabling continuous scanning, it detects all eligible images that you have pushed within 30 days, or pulled within the last 90 days.

Supported operating systems and media types: 
	"application/vnd.docker.distribution.manifest.v1+json"
	"application/vnd.docker.distribution.manifest.v1+prettyjws"
	"application/vnd.oci.image.manifest.v1+json"
	"application/vnd.docker.distribution.manifest.v2+json"

Note: Scratch images and DockerV2ListMediaType images aren't supported.
